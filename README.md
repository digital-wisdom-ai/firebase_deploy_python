# Deploy Firebase Python Functions

A GitHub Action for deploying Python-based Firebase Cloud Functions. This repository serves as both the action implementation and a live example of its usage.

## Features

- üêç Python dependency management from pyproject.toml
- üîê Secure handling of service account credentials
- Detailed deployment summaries

## Usage

Basic usage:

```yaml
- uses: digital-wisdom/deploy-firebase-python@v1
  with:
    project_id: my-firebase-project
    service_account_json_b64: ${{ inputs.service_account_b64 }} # Must be base64 encoded
```

The action requires the service account JSON to be base64 encoded. How you provide this encoded value is up to your workflow design.

## Inputs

| Input                      | Description                                       | Required | Default     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `functions_dir`            | Directory containing functions and pyproject.toml | No       | `functions` |
| `to_deploy`                | Firebase resource to deploy (e.g. functions)      | No       | `functions` |
| `project_id`               | Firebase project ID                               | Yes      | N/A         |
| `service_account_json_b64` | Base64-encoded Firebase service account JSON      | Yes      | N/A         |

## Prerequisites

- Firebase service account key
- Python project with pyproject.toml in functions directory

## Environment Variables

The action automatically sets up:

- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: Points to the service account file
- Firebase project configuration via `firebase use`

## Security

- Service account credentials are securely handled and cleaned up
- Credentials file is automatically removed after deployment
- Uses GitHub's secure token handling

## Versioning

This action follows semantic versioning. You can use it in three ways:

- Major version: `@v1` - Recommended for stability
  ```yaml
  - uses: digital-wisdom/deploy-firebase-python@v1
  ```
- Specific version: `@v1.0.0` - Pinned to exact version
  ```yaml
  - uses: digital-wisdom/deploy-firebase-python@v1.0.0
  ```
- Branch: `@main` - Latest changes (not recommended for production)
  ```yaml
  - uses: digital-wisdom/deploy-firebase-python@main
  ```
